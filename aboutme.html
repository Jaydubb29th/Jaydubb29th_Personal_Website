        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Jordan and I am a prospective tech professional. I have an Energizer Bunny for a 
            dog named "Capri." I love Jesus, I like running, and my favorite food dish is either "shrimp and grits" or 
            "Thai panang curry."

            My areas of interest in terms of ideal careers are web development, software engineering, data science, and 
            data analysis. However, I do not have any formal training or background in these fields. 
            I originally graduated from Georgia State University in May, 2020 with an 
            Accelerated Bachelor's degree in Nursing Sciences. Post graduation, I immediately started working
            as a professional registered nurse (RN) in the heart of Atlanta, GA during the climax of 
            the COVID-19 pandemic. Needless to say, I'm already burnt out and need a change. Although in hindsight, 
            nursing never really was a passion of mine, so I guess this desire to leave the field was 
            destined to come. The only issue though after coming to this realization was finding out what to do 
            next. After several depressing months of feeling stuck in this field of healthcare, sacrificing my 
            mental and physical health, a high school friend (sort of in a similar position, although not in 
            healthcare) introduced me to data analysis. While doing my due diligence into data analysis, 
            a profession completely foreign to me, I was additionally exposed to the broader field of data science. 
            And that came with learning about the use of languages like "SQL", "R", and "Python." These concepts 
            further sparked my interest in other careers such as software engineering and web development. All in 
            all, my interest in all things tech, code, and design has grown expontentially since I was 
            first introduced. The ability to build a website from scratch or develop my own functioning code is 
            absolutely fascinating! I can recall not feeling smart enough to even begin learning coding languages. 
            Not only was I incredibly wrong about the necessary aptitudes to begin in this field, but 
            I completely overlooked the elements of creativity and innovation that now make these careers 
            so intriguing to me.
