# Jaydubb29th_Personal_Website
This is my first personal multi page website. I have no clue what I'm doing yet. <br>

This is my personal multi page website. This is largely a learning experience. For context, at the time of the creation of this repository I started learning HTML exactly one day ago; I haven't started teaching myself CSS yet; and, I've spent about two weeks learning some Python code through the mobile app Sololearn. Needless to say, I'm a beginner and this website will likely reflect that.
